# **Heart Disease Prediction Project**

**Objective:**

The objective of the Heart Disease Prediction Project is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the presence of heart disease in individuals based on a variety of clinical and demographic features. This predictive model aims to aid in early diagnosis and improve the decision-making process for healthcare professionals by providing a reliable tool to assess the likelihood of heart disease.

**Overview of the Process :**

1. Data Collection and Analysis:

   * Loaded the dataset from a CSV file.
   * Explored the dataset to understand its structure, features, and target variable.
   * Checked for missing values and basic statistical measures.

2. Data Splitting:

   * Separated the features and target variable.

3. Model Training:

   * Split the dataset into training and testing sets .
   * Utilized logistic regression with a maximum of 1000 iterations to train the model on the training dataset.

4. Model Evaluation:

   * Evaluated the model's accuracy on both training and test datasets.

5. Predictive System:

   * Developed a predictive function to determine the likelihood of heart disease based on user input data.
